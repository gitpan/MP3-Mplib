MP3/Mplib version 0.02
======================

This is a Perl binding for the mplib written in C. mplib is a library for 
reading and writing id3-tags. Supported versions are those up to and including
v2.3.

The distribution comes with its own patched development version of mplib 
so you don't have to install any additional library prior the installation
of this module. Also, MP3::Mplib wont interfere with existing installations
of mplib on your machine.

TESTED UNDER

Unfortunately this is only tested under Debian/GNU Linux. It should however 
work under other Linuxes. In theory it compiles on all machines with a C
compiler. But as I said, this is not tested. Please let me know if it works 
for you.

Tested under Perl 5.005_03, 5.6.1 and 5.8.0 with gcc 2.95.4 and 3.0.4.
